Hey there! 
This repo contains everything I did for the BrowserStack Testathon 2025 - Manual test cases, automation scripts, and reports.

Manual Test Cases:

All manual test cases are documented here:  

[Test Management URL]

Note: The link points to the root folder. From there, you can expand the respective subfolders to view the individual test cases. I’ve kept it as a single URL for simplicity.

Automation Suite

Included an end-to-end automation framework using:  
1. Java + Selenium
2. TestNG for running tests
3. ExtentReports for detailed reports
4. BrowserStack for cross-browser testing  

All scripts are fully functional and reports are generated automatically.

--Running the Automation Suite

Before running the tests, set your BrowserStack credentials as environment variables.  

-- On Windows (Command Prompt)

set BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME = <your-username>
set BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY = <your-access-key>

-- On macOS / Linux (bash/zsh)

export BROWSERSTACK_USERNAME=<your-username>
export BROWSERSTACK_ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
